"This little bistro on a great street in Paris served up some tasty dishes. If you want to have the most traditional Parisian cuisine, this is your spot. It's a spot that locals and tourists frequent. This means authenticity and ease. The waiters were very helpful, spoke some English, and provided excellent service. I would definitely go back.","This little bistro on a great street in Paris served up some tasty dishes. If you want to have the most traditional Parisian cuisine, this is your spot.

Charming small bistro restaurant with a wonderful menu! We stumbled on the restaurant down a quaint little lane behind our hotel in Paris! We were welcomed in and enjoyed the authenticity of a small establishment but large on service! Our meal was outstanding and I had to have the profiteroles for dessert.

"I, like many, visited for the  croque monsieur/madame.  My madame was fine but by no means the best.  I notice that many restaurants that serve  croques are omitting the béchamel and this, in my opinion is what elevates a  croque monsieur/madame to the level above ham sandwich. It's the creamy smear of this easy white sauce with a hint of nutmeg that makes this dish.   Le Petit Cler omits the béchamel.  It was an open game ham sandwich with melted cheese and an egg.  Meh. The waiter also asked for a tip which I thought was a little classless. It's good but you can do better.","I, like many, visited for the croque monsieur/madame.

"Nice ambience, good food, and great happy hour! Dinner visit before going to the Eiffel Tower and enjoyed our meal. Skirt steak (butchers choice t), salad, and baked potatoes for my husband.

"Le petit Cler lives up to its name, small and quaint bistro where you literally sit on top of each other. The big plus is great service and amazing food. We had the Beef bourguignon tagliatelle pasta and Croque monsieur madame with onion soup Many people said the Beef bourguignon is just fancy beef stew. Well, if it's fancy stew I'm all for it! The beef was tender and the sauce savory and full of flavor as the Beef is braised in red wine. The monsieur madame a fancy and extravagant ham and cheese sandwich topped with an egg. Both entrées were simple in presentation and comforting . The location is walking distance to the eiffel tower and the area outside the restaurant boast some great shops. A definite go to spot.","Le petit Cler lives up to its name, small and quaint bistro where you literally sit on top of each other. The big plus is great service and amazing food.

"Great restaurant open till 11pm.  Perfect for a late night dinner for Americans still jet lagged.  Located in the most charming little Parisian street Rue Cler.  Simple fare at decent prices. Service is excellent.  Friendly helpful English speaking waiters. My son had the flank steak which was tasty.  My wife has the cobb salad with she enjoyed.  My daughter tried the veal blanquette which she said was delicious. I had the duck confit.  Not what I would have ordered on my own, but was the recommended special by the waiter.  It was excellent. The bread was also very good.  But then again bread is good everywhere in Paris.","Great restaurant open till 11pm. Perfect for a late night dinner for Americans still jet lagged.

"We ventured out to Le Petit Cler on the way to the Eiffel Tower. The restaurant is nestled in a small, walkable street with several shops. We didn't have a ton of time but wanted to dine at a French restaurant known for their croque monsieur. Positives: -Service; our waiter was attentive (a strong plus in Paris), kind, and communicative. -The croque monsieur (and salad) did not disappoint -Water is served in a large flask so you don't need to track down your waiter for a refill (important to stay hydrated walking the streets of Paris) Negatives: -the flank steak was more on the rare side (though I requested medium) and desperately needed the accompanying pepper sauce (at an extra cost) for taste All in all, an average dining experience. If you want a French dining experience near the Eiffel Tower (with cute shops around), there is a strong chance Le Petit Cler will check your box.","We ventured out to Le Petit Cler on the way to the Eiffel Tower.

"For our last meal on our Paris vacation, we searched all over the area near the Eiffel Tower and Hotel des Invalides. So happens, we found a great restaurant right next our motel at Grand Hotel Lévêque. Le Petit Cler is relatively small with mostly outdoor dining. The pedestrian street, Rue Cler, has a fair amount of activity. Though mostly local. This is a nice atmosphere. I had six escargot, which I loved. For dinner, my wife and I both had beef bourguignon with tagliatelle pasta. Wine was a very good Cotes de Rhône. And we split a profiteroles for dessert. A wonderful final meal in Paris.","For our last meal on our Paris vacation, we searched all over the area near the Eiffel Tower and Hotel des Invalides.

"This was my first Croque Monsieur of the trip and I was super excited, but it was burnt on one half and was open-faced, which was a bummer. Coffees were good, service was friendly. A lot of the indoor tables, including the one we were at, are so close together they need to be pushed away from the booths on the wall to let out the person on the booth. This was kind of awkward when my husband was in the bathroom and I was trying to get up, but the staff jumps in to help pretty quickly. There are a lot of little cafes in Paris, so I probably wouldn't return to this one, but maybe other menu items are better.","This was my first Croque Monsieur of the trip and I was super excited, but it was burnt on one half and was open-faced, which was a bummer.

We got a little table on the patio, and enjoyed a latte, glass of Bordeaux and Cote de Rhône,  French onion soup and raspberry tart between the 3  of us.

"Recommended by out hotel.  We walked along this gourmet food street.  Many gourmet shops & restaurants presented beautiful foods to those strolling past.  The street is closed to traffic, there were many tables & chairs outside.  There was WiFi, great service, very reasonable prices & a warm inviting setting.  The restaurant was quiet at 6:30 and by 7:00 every table was taken. Disappointed today's special is sold out.  I ordered country pate & my husband a flank steak.  We were both pleased with our choices.  My pate was fresh & tasty.  My husband's steak was cooked to perfection & was lean & juicy. He enjoyed his salad & baked potato as well.","Recommended by out hotel. We walked along this gourmet food street. Many gourmet shops & restaurants presented beautiful foods to those strolling past.

"The service was just mediocre. The French onion soup, which the waiter recommended was the worst I've ever had. The onions were not caramelized at all so the broth was a light yellowish color rather than a rich brown bouillon. It had an acrid onion flavor rather than a sweet and rich oniony flavor. The cheese and crouton were fine. The Beef Bourguignon was full of unrendered fat. The flavor was nice, as was the pasta it was on. But there were pork belly pieces in it, too, and no vegetables. Definitely different, and not in a good way. The atmosphere was generic, nothing special. I would definitely skip this place.","The service was just mediocre.

"Saw that this place was known for their croque monsieur so we decided to try it. We arrived on a weekday at 1pm and luckily got seated immediately. Our waiter was friendly and also spoke english and gave us an english menu. Tried the special of the day which was a lasagna, the french onion soup, and the croque monsieur. The french onion soup was probably the best I've ever had with its nice broth and sweet onions. The croque monsieur was hot and the bread had a nice crispy intro bite into the cheese. The lasagna was also received praise around the whole table, with its tomato sauce not being too sour. Overall, super glad we went here. It was actually one of my favorite places during my whole trip.","Saw that this place was known for their croque monsieur so we decided to try it.

"My first meal in Paris, and I was excited for the croque madame, the ham and cheese toast with egg on top. I was happily eating until I realized the whole toast was burnt on the bottom. Each bite tasted burnt. We had escargots as well which was good, but was very disappointed by our burnt croque madames. We asked if it was supposed to be burnt and they said they can't control the temp of the oven to check if it's burnt.","My first meal in Paris, and I was excited for the croque madame, the ham and cheese toast with egg on top.

"We ordered: lemonade, coke, duck confit(special), beef Bourguignon, 3 cheese assortment, and creme brulee. Total came to about 73 euros/78 USD. my only complaint would be my wife's pasta and it's sauce was a bit 'meh', everything else was fantastic; the duck was crispy and moist, the beef was extremely tender and flavorful, the cheeses were excellent and far better than any we've had in America(and we frequently do charcuterie), and the creme brulee had a bit of a toasted marshmallow flavor to it which was awesome. Our particular server was very friendly and very attentive, I didn't catch his name but he was this way with all of his tables. Worth mentioning he spoke English well too.

Nothing super special but a solid meals for a solid price in an expensive city. We loved the Sunday dinner of chicken and potatoes, as well as the croque monsieur. Simple, well prepared, and quick.

"Located on the dynamic Rue Cler street where various cafes, restaurants, wine and cheese shops are located. Although this place is filled with several tourists, it's a good respite if one has been walking all day. During this rainy and cold day, I tried the French onion soup. Not bad, but the broth needs more I think. Tried the house steak tartare. Again it was not bad, but it didn't blow my mind.

"Le Petit Cler was amazing!! We found this restaurant on Yelp after visiting the Eiffel Tower. It was a bit far but it was worth the walk. We sat outside on the covered patio. It was pretty cold out that night, 30 degrees, but the patio was really cozy. Le Petit Cler does a great job with the amount of heat lamps they have outside. Le Petit Cler's staff was really amazing. They were welcoming and answered all of our questions. We ordered two red wines, the homemade Duck Foie Gras, Duck Confit, Flank Steak, & a Creme Brûlée. We started with a bottle of red wine & the home made Duck Foie Gras. The wine was really good and the price wasn't bad either. As for the Foie Gras, it was amazing!! I would recommend getting this for the table to share. For our entrees we got the Duck Confit & the Flank Steak. The Duck Confit was for sure the winner out of the two, but the steak was also really good. It's just hard to compete with a good Duck Confit. I ordered the steak medium rare. Accompanying the steak was a nice salad and wonderful potatoes. We also got another bottle of wine, which was also really good and easy on the wallet. For dessert we got the Creme Brûlée. It was a perfect ending to a delicious meal. The next time I'm in Paris I will for-sure comeback to Le Petit Cler.  If you are on the fence about trying try this place out, just do it.

"First dinner in Paris! We stopped by around 6pm on a Saturday and made it just in time before the dinner rush! They have indoor seating and an outdoor wrapped patio with extra strength heaters that will keep you warm and toasty so don't be afraid to sit outside! Our server was really nice and helpful--it seemed like he was the only one in there, but was able to keep the fort down. There was an English menu so we didn't have to use google translate to figure out what we wanted to order--though I did surf through some Yelp photos before we went to the restaurant ;). We started with the full bread board which came with some prosciutto, pate and salami all topped with some pickled onions and cornichons (fermented cucumber) (our server also gave us a giant vase of cornichons and onions and we totally went overboard with them with no regrets!). The board was delicious, but it definitely made us feel very stuffed afterwards. For the main course, I ordered the flank steak which came with a side salad and your choice of a baked potato or diced potatoes. I thought the steak was cooked to perfection and I loved the little side of greens since you don't really get that when traveling :). Note: Ask for mustard!! Their mustard is smooth and spicy and pairs perfectly with the steak (or anything really!). We finished with a pear digestif to help us keep all of that food down. Overall, great service and great food! Also, the website's menu seems to be a bit outdated. For example, the Monday meal special on our menu was the beef bourguignon but the website has it as a beef skewer. Also, the daily specials are 14 pounds not 13.5! Enjoy!","First dinner in Paris! We stopped by around 6pm on a Saturday and made it just in time before the dinner rush! They have indoor seating and an outdoor wrapped patio with extra strength heaters that will keep you warm and toasty so don't be afraid to sit outside!

"Visited twice, once for dinner, and another day for breakfast.  The beef bourguignon was good, and service was great.  The 15 euro complete breakfast was hot, fresh and very tasty with croissant, fresh juice, coffee or hot chocolate with an omelet that was almost perfect in size, flavor and texture.  A definite revisit will come on our next trip to Paris!","Visited twice, once for dinner, and another day for breakfast. The beef bourguignon was good, and service was great.

"We have enjoyed this Le Petite immensely! It is right around the corner from our hotel and has been a life saver for two ladies operating on a different timezone who also like to eat before 7pm ... a challenge to find a dinner place that serves a nice dinner before 7:30.  The Pinot Nori is lovely. The duck Shepard's pie was delightful.  The service good, atmosphere nice intimate French cafe.","We have enjoyed this Le Petite immensely!

"Amazing restaurant to eat at if you want to roam around the Eiffel Tower and Champ de Mars after dinner. The outdoor seating allows you to people watch and also gives you the opportunity to enjoy looking at the small street while you eat or drink. I personally preferred the indoor seating, as it felt more cozy inside. Our waiter immediately gave our party an English menu which was very attentive of him to do. He also spoke very good English, so communication was not an issue. I ordered the Flank Steak with the baked potato which was alright. The reason why I did not like it too much was because there was no salt or pepper on the steak, which made it a bit bland to eat. The meat was also tough to cut. I still rate this restaurant a 5/5 because all the other dishes were enjoyable, the atmosphere is pleasant for dinner, and the service was incredible. Another person in my party ordered the Sauteed Chicken marinated in coconut milk and curry, which was very delicious. I was skeptical at first because it is a Thai inspired dish; I did not have high expectations for it. The chicken was very tender and juicy, while the marinade was creamy but not too overpowering. Easily a 5/5. The third person in my party ordered the Wednesday special which was the Baked Pork Ribs. The meat came off the bone without any effort. We did not have to put pressure on the meat to get it off the bone. The sauce on the ribs was amazing and the meat was very soft and juicy. For dessert, we ordered the Creme Brulee which was phenomenal. The sugar on top of the custard was perfectly crunchy and hard. The custard had an amazing texture. I think this was the best creme brulee that I've had during my stay in Paris and I've had creme brulee everyday, at different cafes and restaurants. The only suggestion that I have is to use less vanilla bean or vanilla extract, as it was a tad overpowering in the custard. Besides this small issue, it was a perfect creme brulee. I was very impressed with my experience at this restaurant and I hope to pay a visit if I go to Paris again.","Amazing restaurant to eat at if you want to roam around the Eiffel Tower and Champ de Mars after dinner.

"Le Petit Cler was one of my favorite restaurants in Paris - and quickly became one of my top favorite restaurants ever. My husband and I had bookmarked/starred Le Petit Cler as we started researching our trip to Paris. The pictures of the Croque Madame did my husband in, while I was mesmerized by the many offerings of tartines (and a great wine list), as well as the fact that Le Petit Cler is on Rue Cler, one of the cutest little streets in Paris. Our first visit to Le Petit Cler was for dinner - I asked for a table outside (in French), and my husband and I were brought two French menus, which gave my husband anxiety from the get-go because he can read about zero French. Our server came over after some time to take our order (again, just a reminder - this is not rudeness, they're allotting enough time for you to absorb the menu, so don't be surprised if you're sitting at a table for a bit prior to someone welcoming you/taking drink orders), and saw my husband on Yelp reading the English version the of the menu. We ordered a carafe of water as well as a bottle of the Roquefort Bordeaux (28 €), and requested a bit more time to order our meals. A new server came back, who promptly placed an English menu down for my husband and then (in English) asked if we were ready to order. My husband ordered the special plat of the day, the beef lasagna (there's a different special plate each day - all are printed on the menu for 13,5 €), and I ordered the warm goat cheese/tomato/endive tartine (14 €). We sipped our wine (delicious - highly recommend! until our food arrived. Not only was the plating absolutely gorgeous, but the food was incredible. Everything was perfectly seasoned, fresh, and filling - like the kind of meal where you're quiet because you're absolutely loving what you're eating. We finished our dinner, and then ordered a cheese plate (a Camembert and chevre), and my husband ordered the chocolat Petit Pot (literally a little jar of chocolate mousse - it was delicious). The service was amazing, the food incredible, and the ambiance so traditionally Parisian that we decided we needed to come back the next day for our final lunch in Paris. Our lunch the next day had some things in common with our first visit: a seat outside, the same bottle of Bordeaux, and amazing service. This time I ordered the tartine with raw salmon and cream cheese (17 €), and my husband ordered the Croque Madame (15 €) that he had lusted over via Yelp photos. It was a particularly hot day in Paris, and sitting in the sun during our lunch emboldened us to each order a bowl of Berthillon ice cream (vanilla for my husband, raspberry sorbet pour moi). It was delicious, and exactly what we needed on such a hot day. All in all, Le Petit Cler was the perfect Parisian experience - the food was delicious, the service wonderful, the ambiance absolutely perfect, and the people watching completely top notch.

"My sister and I were in Paris for the day. We checked into a nearby hotel and decided to have brunch first before heading to the Eiffel Tower. I did research and Le Petit Cler was closeby with lots of decent reviews. The restaurant is a typical, traditional Parisian cafe with an outdoor patio. Server was friendly and offered us an English menu, which was helpful. We settled and ordered the raw tartare and the beef bourguignon. Overall, it was a lot of food! The raw tartare was okay because it got a little too heavy for me towards the end. I was too caught up on ordering the tartare that I neglected the fact that I don't like salad nor baked potato. I wish I ordered something else to get my money's worth. As for the beef bourguignon, my sister said the wine-braised beef was good and was glad that she tried a traditional French entree.","My sister and I were in Paris for the day.

It was well seasoned and the texture was perfect for putting on bread or eating alone.  We also ordered the Croque Madam and escargot but neither was impressive.

"My wife and I were in Paris in April 2016 and we had just toured the beautiful Eiffel Tower. We wanted to walk down Rue Cler, The most famous Market street in Paris. It was lunch time and we started looking at the different restaurant menus as we made our way down the famous street. We came across Le Petit Cler and decided this was the best spot for authentic French cuisine that was super affordable. Once inside, we sat down and each ordered the French beer, Kronenbourg 1664. We were given complimentary French bread and we asked for an English version of the normally French menu. I really wanted to try the Veritable Tartare (or Raw Beef Tartare) as I had only had it once before in New York City. My wife had the Emince De Volaille (Sautéed Chicken marinated in Coconut and Red Curry). The Tartare was very fresh and had such great flavor. It's not something you can order everyday and you might as well let the French prepare it right. My wife's Chicken dish was also very good and had a wonderful curry taste. The restaurant was very packed and seemed to be a popular spot for locals and tourists alike. We enjoyed the food, the atmosphere and the affordability of a nice French meal. We definitely recommend Le Petit Cler if you are strolling on our near Rue Cler. Bon appétit","My wife and I were in Paris in April 2016 and we had just toured the beautiful Eiffel Tower.

We were given complimentary French bread and we asked for an English version of the normally French menu. I really wanted to try the Veritable Tartare (or Raw Beef Tartare) as I had only had it once before in New York City. My wife had the Emince De Volaille (Sautéed Chicken marinated in Coconut and Red Curry). The Tartare was very fresh and had such great flavor. It's not something you can order everyday and you might as well let the French prepare it right. My wife's Chicken dish was also very good and had a wonderful curry taste. The restaurant was very packed and seemed to be a popular spot for locals and tourists alike. We enjoyed the food, the atmosphere and the affordability of a nice French meal. We definitely recommend Le Petit Cler if you are strolling on our near Rue Cler. Bon appétit",en,Yelp,Le Petit Cler,,,
"Another rainy day in Paris, another new restaurant! There was a short line when we arrived, but thankfully, it moved quite quickly. I wasn't really feeling much of an appetite, so I ordered three soft boiled eggs with bread. My sister ordered their special of the day, roast chicken. She said that it was slightly dry, but still really tasty overall. My dad ordered a runny ham omelette, which came with bread. Meanwhile, my mom got a steak with baked potatoes, and loved it. She's a major fan of potatoes, and appreciate the sour cream that it came with. A decent meal overall, but nothing spectacular.","Another rainy day in Paris, another new restaurant!

"Came here and got the flank steak and I was expecting my potatoes to be diced but it was served whole. (I am assuming you probably have to ask to have your potatoes a certain way) However, the steak was good and the salad that came with was too. We also order the croque madame and that was good too. Portion was pretty big. Service was tourist friendly and they had an English menu which was nice since a lot of the places we went to didn't offer it to us.","Came here and got the flank steak and I was expecting my potatoes to be diced but it was served whole.

"Awesome place for dinner near the Eiffel Tower. On our first night in Paris, we decided to eat here due to good recommendations. The restaurant is very easy to find along the very popular pedestrian street Rue Cler. We were attended to immediately and sat near the back of the restaurant. The place itself is tiny so the ""back"" was literally 10 feet from the front entrance. We ordered a variety of typical French plates to share as our meal: escargots, tomato and mozzarella salad, cheese platter, and a foie gras board. Everything was great, especially the foie gras, so creamy and satisfying without being too pungent. The tomatoes were also very fresh and sweet. The escargots were a bit on the smaller size but still tasty. We ordered 2 cheeses for our board but you can request up to 4. They never told us what the cheeses were but we guessed that it was a brie and goat cheese. It also came with a slice of butter. And we had a glass of the recommended rose wine to go with our meal. The other amazing aspect of this place was the waiters. We were serviced by about 4 different guys and each one was extremely friendly and very attentive. They also spoke English very well which made the entire experience that much better. The only negative was how packed the place was. Luckily, we were seated by the wall so we had some privacy but we noticed that the other patrons were literally within 6 inches of the next table over. Had that been us, we wouldn't have had as great a time. We arrived around 7:30 and the restaurant was about one third full. However, when we left around 8:30, every table was packed to the point where even leaving was a struggle. The French are known to dine late in the evening so if you eat around 7:30 to 8:00, most places shouldntbe too packed just yet. Anyway, Le Petit Cler was an awesome experience for dinner on our first night back in Paris. Price- 70euros for: 2 glasses of rose, 6 escargots, cheese plate with 2 cheeses, tomato and mozzarella salad, foie gras (a bit pricy but the area is nice and upscale and it is Paris after all!)","Awesome place for dinner near the Eiffel Tower.

"This is our first nite in Paris and we were staying nearby.  The staffs were all very nice.  I got a simple ham and mushroom omelette which was cooked a bit runny for my taste, but I didn't mind one bit.  My wife got the beef tartare which she excitedly enjoyed and the portion was pretty darn generous.  My son got the Sun special of chicken with mash potatoes which for that low price, it was quite worth it.  We also shared an order of escargot which was yum yum delicious.  We top the night off with a creme bulee which was huge to share and hit the spot.  All in all, great food and awesome service.","This is our first nite in Paris and we were staying nearby.

"Le Petit Cler was the first meal of our vacation in Paris. Our AirBNB host recommended the cute cafe. Delicious, the trip was off to a great start! We went early on a Saturday morning and were able to grab a table in the enclosed ""outside"" area. The heat lamps made it very comfortable on the cold rainy morning. I ordered the popular Croque Madame. The dish is crispy bread toasted with ham and cheese topped with a fried egg. YUM!! It's one of those things you almost want to order another when you finish eating it. We liked it so much, we came back on the last morning of our trip and ordered it again. Definitely try this dish if you dine here. My fiancé ordered the Saturday special of duck confit. Mashed potatoes with tasty morsels of duck mixed in, what's not to love? Service was attentive. They were quick to refill our water container and bring all of the food out. Get the croque madame! You'll love it.","Le Petit Cler was the first meal of our vacation in Paris.

"This was our first lunch in Paris off the plane. Searches Yelp: ""Croque Madam."" Results: Le Petit Cler = and I can confirm the results lead us to the right place and will not disappoint. To the biz owner - Yelp is literally sending you hundreds of people based off of this search, and yes we are walking cliches. The restaurant is super cute with a traditional Parisan patio out front, and even comes equipped with heaters. We split the Croque Madam because it was huge. It also came with a super simple and delish side salad. We also opted for two espressos, and to our surprise they came with little chocolates. Was this the best croque madam I've ever had in my life? No, but it will certainly satisfy your craving. If you're looking for a solid choice along the Rue Cler, this is your spot.","This was our first lunch in Paris off the plane.

"I bookmarked this cafe based on the Yelp reviews and because it was close to our hotel. Was worth the visit and actually one of the best places we ate in while in Paris. We went for a late ""breakfast"" one morning (during the week and not crowded at all - which was great for us) and were greeted by a very nice waiter who did his best to communicate with us in English. The cafe is adorable inside - traditional Parisian cafe. Food: Mom ordered the carrot soup, which was ""out of this world"" and the vegetarienne, which had all FRESH vegetables on it. My kid and I ordered the croque monsieur - his with no ham, mine with it, both which came with small side salad. It was amazing! The bread was so crisp and the cheese melted perfectly on top. I have had a couple of different versions of the croque monsieur this week, and this one was the best. Unfortunately, we didn't get to try anything else on the (somewhat limited) menu.

"Walked over after visiting the Eiffel Tower. We were starving and looking for a casual place to grab a bite to eat. We sat outside overlooking Rue Cler, it was cute. There were some locals sitting around us, and the only downside (which is not specific to this cafe but rather Paris as a whole) was the constant smell of cigarettes. For a small restaurant, the service was excellent. The waiter spoke English well and was super helpful. We ordered the steak tartare, escargot, eggs, and some coffee. The tartare was excellent and super refreshing on a hot day. It came with a little side salad and potatoes, which were very tasty. The snails were good, well cooked and with a yummy buttery/herby sauce. The eggs were just ok, had a little too much mayo for me and I love mayo, came with a little legume salad. Coffees were good and came with a cute little dark chocolate square. Get a glass of wine with your meal, can't beat the price and the pinot noir was good.","Walked over after visiting the Eiffel Tower.

"I read online that this place has the best croque monsieur (a decadent traditional French ham and cheese sandwich) in Paris, and online was right. Wow. What a delicious meal. I was starving at 10 PM last night, and was just desperately googling where to go to dinner in Paris. I walked into the PACKED restaurant, expecting to have to wait at least 40 minutes, but the maître d' sat me right away! I had tapwater for free - a rarity in Europe! And then I got the sandwich and a side salad (side salad free! Yay!). The sandwich was perfectly savory and rich. Not too much cheese, not too much ham, not too much bread (trust me, most places mess this up ALL the time somehow). I felt like a very valuable customer here and I would most certainly return. Cool floors if you're into that Instagram type content when you go out to eat. I saw a lot of people eating ice cream there too, so it was probably really good! I'd have to go back and see, haha! They even have free wifi and don't get mad if you linger a little longer just to search the web. I give this restaurant 5 fabulous stars because it is yummy, quick, convenient, lives up to its reputation, and treats its clients with respect. The service is amazing. The waiter kept coming back and asking if I needed anything else-- no, thank you, this sandwich is DELICIOUS, sir!","I read online that this place has the best croque monsieur (a decadent traditional French ham and cheese sandwich) in Paris, and online was right.

"Great attentive service. Everyone here on the staff spoke French and English I asked the server what they were known for/what's their customers' favorite dish. He pointed me to a grilled chicken with a sort of sweet glaze severed alongside a sweet baked potato and arugula salad. It was fresh simple and delicious. The baked potato NEEDED NOTHING, no salt, no butter, no seasoning , no sour cream and was one of the best baked potatoes I've had in my life. The shop is along a closed off street across from a fresh fruit stand which adds to local flavor and gives you more of a small town feel even in the heart of Paris. Price: I paid about 19 euros for my meal, water, earl grey tea and lemon cake. Which seemed more than fair. Crowd: Perfect for groups of 2-4. Larger parties may have issues being accommodated in the smaller more cozy layout. Highly recommend for food or even a few glasses of chilled champagne sitting out on the sidewalk. Le Petit Cler gets my vote.","Great attentive service. Everyone here on the staff spoke French and English I asked the server what they were known for/what's their customers' favorite dish.

Price: I paid about 19 euros for my meal, water, earl grey tea and lemon cake. Which seemed more than fair. Crowd: Perfect for groups of 2-4. Larger parties may have issues being accommodated in the smaller more cozy layout. Highly recommend for food or even a few glasses of chilled champagne sitting out on the sidewalk.

Wow!! The little restaurant was amazing. I found it off of a blog months back after deciding to vacation in Paris for a few days. On our first night in Paris I wanted to try something easy and delicious and this was within 10 minute walk of our hotel. This was hands down the best beef bourguignon I have ever had. The French bread was delicious and the service was friendly. I don't speak any French and had no problem and the staff was warm and inviting but didn't  hover. The price was reasonable. Two main dishes and one glass of wine was about 30 euro.,Wow!! The little restaurant was amazing. I found it off of a blog months back after deciding to vacation in Paris for a few days.

"The food was phenomenal. The staff was great. Wondering why four stars? Well, maybe it's me being an American, but the tables are so cramped together that you're just up in everyone's business and vice versa - I hate this. You literally can't move, and that just brings down any dining experience in my book. If you can get past this, stop by, really. They're friendly, fast, and the food is great. We had escargot, and an incredible Croque Madam (ham, cheese, and an egg) as starters. We split a flank steak and potatoes for the main dish, also very nice. Steak was a bit underdone, more rare than the medium rare we asked for, but great nonetheless.","The food was phenomenal. The staff was great. Wondering why four stars?
